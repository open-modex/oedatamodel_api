They help to process\njson data and enable to apply a custom mapping on the json data (See apply_custom_mapping).\n\nCurrently available custom functions are:\n- repeat\n- items\n- zip\n- to object\n- unique\n- exclude\n- group by\n    group_by allows for the expref to be either a number of\n    a string, so we have some special logic to handle this.\n    We evaluate the first array element and verify that it's\n    either a string of a number.  We then create a key function\n    that validates that type, which requires that remaining array\n    elements resolve to the same type as the first element.\n- group by dict\n     group_dict_by allows for the expref to be either a number of\n    a string, so we have some special logic to handle this.\n    We evaluate the first array element and verify that it's\n    either a string of a number.
