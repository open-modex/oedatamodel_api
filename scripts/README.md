## Skripts to work with OEP and Databus API

### Usage
The Scripts found in this folder can be used to Upload or Register Data to the [OEP](https://openenergy-platform.org/)
or Register Data on the [Databus](https://energy.databus.dbpedia.org/)
They can be especially handy if multiple Datasets are to be handled.

###

###  [OEP](https://openenergy-platform.org/) Dataset Registration
- Skript: multiple_databus_registration.py
- Purpose: Registers multiple .json Metadata-files on the [OEP](https://openenergy-platform.org/)

To use the script, you must have an API key and user account at OEP. You can either add them to your environment
variables or enter them directly into the script where they are read.
