You can use markdown to format the content of the issue. This [cheat-sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) helps you to do that.

## Issue description

Describe the problem and context in general (what did you want to achieve), making clear where it occurs (e.g. operating system, file, script name, function, etc.) and provide a brief description of how the problem was triggered and what has already been tried to solve the problem.

General questions about an application (How to do that?) should be clearly distinguishable from bugs that occur while using an application or feature requests that extend the application. For example You can add a label to the issue (Widget to the right).

You can address someone directly (@githubname) or assign the issue as a task to someone (widget to the right).

## Suggested Workflow checklist
